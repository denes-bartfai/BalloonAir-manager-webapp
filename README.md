## Introduction

This project aims to develop an informative web application for a small company operating as a mobile vendor throughout Hungary, specializing in toys and balloons. Currently, the company manages its operations by gathering data through Excel sheets and paper records. The primary goal is to modernize their data management process by transitioning to a web application that not only stores future data efficiently but also standardizes existing records.

The key objectives of the web application include:

1. Event Monitoring: The application will enable the company to monitor various events based on sales, city, and weather conditions. This will allow them to identify and prioritize events that yield optimal results while minimizing efforts on less profitable ones.

2. Data Standardization: In addition to saving future data, the application will incorporate mechanisms to standardize existing records. This ensures consistency and reliability in the data gathered, facilitating accurate analysis and decision-making.

3. Features: The web application will include features such as statistics and graphs to visualize sales data and trends, a contact list for managing customer and vendor relationships, and a curated list of useful links to streamline daily operations.

By centralizing data management and providing tools for analysis and decision support, the web application aims to enhance efficiency and transparency in the company's operations, ultimately empowering them to make informed business decisions.

## Technologies

- ASP.NET v8.0.4: A powerful and versatile framework for building web applications and APIs using C# programming language. ASP.NET provides a robust set of tools for developing scalable and secure applications on the .NET platform.

- Entity Framework: An object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET that enables developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. Entity Framework simplifies data access by abstracting database interactions, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than database plumbing.

- MS SQL: A relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. MS SQL Server is widely used for storing and managing structured data in enterprise applications, offering features such as transaction support, data integrity, and advanced querying capabilities.

- React v18.2.0: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage application state, making it ideal for building dynamic and interactive web applications.

- Vite v5.1.6: A next-generation build tool that offers fast and efficient development experience for modern web projects. Vite leverages native ES module imports to provide instant server startup and rapid hot module replacement (HMR), improving developer productivity during the development process.

- Material UI: A React UI framework based on Google's Material Design guidelines. Material UI provides a set of customizable and reusable components that enable developers to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces with ease.
